# Background Keylogger
This script was written to monitor any keypresses from a numpad and execute any desired command.
Since the person who commisioned the script was particular that no other dependencies should be used, the `keyboard` module's source code was downloaded and added to the project.
The `keyboard` module is opensource (MIT liscence), so the use of this module in this project is allowed.
To make use of this keylogger, one needs to just replace the print commands in the `keylogger.py` file to any command they want on the desired keypress.
